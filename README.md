## 🧩 Project Overview

Developed by a team of four under the name **Silicon**, the project integrates embedded systems, mobile technology, and cloud-based analytics to offer a seamless user experience.

The system consists of:

- A custom-designed embedded device with ultra-low power operation  
- A purpose-built enclosure that fits neatly where the gas tank is placed  
- A mobile application for setup, configuration, and analytics  
- Firebase as the real-time backend

### 🔧 Hardware Highlights
- Custom PCB and enclosure designed for practical use and aesthetics  
- Battery-powered embedded device with over **6 months** of runtime on a single set of batteries  
- **Wi-Fi + BLE** connectivity for versatile remote access and local configuration  
- Power-efficient design optimized for long-term use in home environments

### 📱 Software & App Features
- Intuitive mobile app for:
  - Initial setup and device pairing  
  - Real-time gas level monitoring  
  - Custom configuration of device parameters  
  - Analytics dashboard with predictions and usage history  
- Support for monitoring multiple devices from a single app  
- Anywhere, anytime access to your LPG gas status

### 📊 Smart Features
- Intelligent prediction of gas usage and refill cycles  
- Historical data analytics and trend visualization  
- Alerts and notifications for low levels or unusual usage patterns

### ✨ Design & Vision
- Enclosure design matches modern kitchen aesthetics  
- Built with a focus on **usability**, **power efficiency**, and **visual appeal**  
- A comprehensive **market and business analysis** was conducted prior to development to validate real-world needs and feasibility
